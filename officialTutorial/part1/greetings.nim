This document is a tutorial for the programming language Nim.
This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic programming concepts like
variables, types or statements but is kept very basic.
The manual contains many more examples of the advanced language features.
All code examples in this tutorial, as well as the ones found in the rest of Nim's documentation, follow the Nim style guide.
